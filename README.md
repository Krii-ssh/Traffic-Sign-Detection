# TrafficSignDetection-AI
YOLO-based traffic sign detection in Google Colab

# Summary
This project focuses on traffic sign detection using the YOLOv8 algorithm.The project aims to accurately detect and label various traffic signs within images.


# Key Features:
- Utilizes YOLOv8 algorithm for object detection
- Training performed on a dataset containing images with annotated traffic signs
- Labels and trains for 10 classes of traffic signs
- Detection results include bounding boxes drawn around the detected signs
- Provides the name of the detected traffic sign along with precision
